This folder contains fixtures for automated tests.

Fixtures can be created from app exports, using the "Export" button. The exported `.txt` files can be processed with the `add-fixtures` script. Example:

    npm run add-fixtures --input fast-export-2024-11-19.txt

The resulting fixtures should be committed and pushed.
